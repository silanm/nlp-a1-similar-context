*Remarks: GloVe Gensim is removed from the online Streamlit app due to its large model size.*

![](images/giggle-in-action.gif)

Models are trained on a sample of the Reuters corpus, 100-dimensional embeddings, batch size of 128, and 5 epochs.

Similarity Scores on Giggle:
- Skipgram and GloVe models may capture co-occurrence patterns but not semantic meaning
- Though the models give high similarity scores but the ouput similar words are still not semantically related to the input word.
- GloVe Gensim provided the most meaningful results in this case e.g., `thin` --> `thick`, `flat`, `thinner`

# Similar Context

Finding top 10 most similar words to "dollar" across four models.

| Model | Top Words | Similarity Range |
| ----- | --------- | :--------------: |
| Skipgram | `put`, `owned`, `must`, `taking`, `forecast`, `shareholders`, `deficit`, `drop`, `australia`, `against` | 17 - 20 |
| Skipgram (Negative) | `canada`, `electric`, `buy`, `surplus`, `australian`, `services`, `department`, `income`, `sales`, `feb` | 24 - 29 |
| GloVe | `energy`, `far`, `conrac`, `coffee`, `trust`, `holds`, `bill`, `major`, `proxmire`, `better` | 21 - 29 |
| GloVe (Gensim) | `currency`, `greenback`, `euro`, `dollars`, `currencies`, `yen`, `peso`, `weaker`, `price`, `trading` | 0.6 - 0.7 |

### Observations
- **Skipgram**: These words are loosely connected to financial contexts and aren't directly related to `dollar`.
- **Negative Sampling**: These words are more financially and economically oriented.
- **GloVe**: GloVe captures co-occurrence patterns across the corpus but seems to mix relevant financial terms (`bill`, `trust`) with unrelated ones (`coffee`).
- **Gensim**: Highly relevant wordsâ€”all directly related to currency and finance.
